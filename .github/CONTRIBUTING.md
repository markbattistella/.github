# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please read through this guide before submitting any issues or pull requests.

## Before You Start

Discuss any changes you wish to make via an issue or other agreed method with the repository owners before opening a pull request. This ensures effort is aligned and avoids duplicate work.

Please also review and follow our Code of Conduct in all interactions.

## Pull Request Process

1. Remove any install or build artefacts before finalising a build layer.
2. Update `README.md` with details of any interface changes — this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Name your pull request using the `yyyy-mm-dd - Description` format (e.g. `2026-01-31 - New feature`). This keeps the history consistent and easy to browse.
4. A pull request may be merged once it has sign-off from the maintaining developer(s). If you do not have merge permissions, request a reviewer to merge it for you.

## Versioning

This project uses base level [`SemVer`](http://semver.org/) with a `yy.mm.dd` date-based format without padded zeros. For example: `26.1.31`, not `26.01.31`.
