# Reporting Security Issues

We take security bugs in our projects seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## How to Report a Security Issue

To report a security issue, you can use one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory**

   Use the *Report a Vulnerability* button (if available) under the `Security > Report a Vulnerability` button. This is usually in the address of: `https://github.com/markbattistella/[your-repo]/security/advisories/new`.

2. **Mastodon**: Contact us on Mastodon [@markbattistella@mastodon.au](https://mastodon.au/@markbattistella).

3. **Security Issue GitHub Issue**: Open a new issue on our GitHub repository and use the "Security Issue" template to provide details about the vulnerability.

After the initial reply to your report, we will aim to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Security Issues in Third-Party Modules

If you find a security bug in a third-party module that we use, please report it to the person or team maintaining that module.
