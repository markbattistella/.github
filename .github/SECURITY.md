# Reporting Security Issues

We take security bugs in our projects seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## How to Report a Security Issue

To report a security issue, you can use one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisory** — use the *Report a Vulnerability* button under `Security > Report a Vulnerability` in the affected repository.

2. **Contact form** — reach out via [markbattistella.com/contact](https://markbattistella.com/contact).

3. **Social media** — send a direct message on Mastodon or Bluesky.

After the initial reply to your report, we will aim to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Security Issues in Third-Party Modules

If you find a security bug in a third-party module that we use, please report it to the person or team maintaining that module.
